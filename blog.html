    <h1>What Makes Art </h1>

    <p> A friend, commenting on a new building, "I'm not sure if I hate it or love it! I want to hate it but I think
    I love it..." </p>
    
   <p1>Without that tension, all you've done is what's been done before.

        <h2> Chump (Don't get played)</h2>

        <p> how did Berneie Madoff do it? How did he steal twnety billion dollars from people who shoud have
        known better? It doesn't matter if you went to univeristy or not -- you can still be played as a
        chump.
        
       <p>To pull off a signifcant deception, you generally need two things: A deceiver and a crowd of people open to being deceived.
        
        
        
        <p>
            Once those are present, the deceiver brings out the big lie.
        
        
        <p>
            For lots of reaosns, people are open to looking for shortucts and a new reality, even if no shortcuts are available. They may have been mistreated 
            might be struggling, or they may merely be greedy, looking to outdo the other guy. In the case of Madoff, he was even able to take in charities, with boards that meant well but 
            were in a hurry to scale. 
        

        <p>
            Frustartion in the face of the way things are makes us open to the big lie. Frustration and fear and 
            anger can suspend our ablity to ask difficult quesitons, to listen to thoughtful critics, to do our 
            homework.
        

        <p>
            And the big lie is alwasy presetn when we get played. To be a chump (not merely the victim) is to be
            open to the big lie. Not merely open to it, eager to buy it.
        

        <p>
            Number make it easy to tell a big lie. People hate numbers, and they seem so real.
        

        <p>
            Anti-intellectualism, disregard for the scientifc method and conspiracy theroies also set the stage for a big lie.
